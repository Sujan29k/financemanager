// 💡 Step 2: Other Useful Features to Add
// Here are features you can gradually add to make your Finance Manager more powerful:

// 📊 1. Income Tracking
// Add a separate form and model for tracking income.

// Show total income, total expense, and remaining balance.

// 📅 2. Filter by Date / Category
// Add dropdowns to filter expenses by day, week, month, or category (Food, Travel, Utilities, etc.).

// 📈 3. Visual Charts
// Use Recharts or Chart.js to display:

// Monthly expenses

// Pie chart for category breakdown

// 💰 4. Budgets
// Set monthly budgets for different categories.

// Show warnings when a budget is exceeded.

// 🔐 5. Authentication
// Use NextAuth.js so each user has their own dashboard.

// Secure API routes with user sessions.

// 📱 6. Responsive Design
// Use responsive UI for mobile (use CSS Modules or Tailwind).

// Add dark/light theme toggles.

// ⏳ 7. Recurring Expenses/Income
// Mark expenses/income as recurring (e.g., rent, salary).

// Automatically add them on a monthly basis.

// Would you like me to help add MongoDB integration right now, or would you prefer to explore one of the new features above (like charts or budgets)?
